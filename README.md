## Ello IFTTT Integration

This app manages all of the ins and outs of Ello's integration with
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). It uses a combination of JWT OAuth tokens, Ello API
calls, and a Kinesis stream consumer to both send triggers and service actions.

It's a fairly vanilla Rails 5 application backed by a Postgres database.
