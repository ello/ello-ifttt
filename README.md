This app manages all of the ins and outs of Ello's integration with
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). It uses a combination of JWT OAuth tokens, Ello API
calls, and a Kinesis stream consumer to both send triggers and service actions.

### Setup

This is a vanilla Rails 5 (API) application, so getting it started is fairly
standard:

* Install RVM/Rbenv/Ruby 2.3
* Install PostgreSQL (9.4 or newer) if you don't have it already
* Clone this repo
* Run `bundle install` and `bundle exec rake db:setup`
* Fire up the API server with `bundle exec rails server`
* Run the test suite with `bundle exec rake`
